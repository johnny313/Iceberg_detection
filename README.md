##Overview
I am making an attempt at the Kaggel Iceberg Detection Chellange as the study problem (https://www.kaggle.com/c/statoil-iceberg-classifier-challenge), using this as an opportunity to deepen my understanding of Convo Nets.

The code here is still very much in progress... 

###Goals
-Learn more about convolutional neural networks for feature detection
-Implement a range of convolutional neural network architectures in Tensorflow
